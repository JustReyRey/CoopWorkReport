            <h5>Problem Solving</h5>
            <p>Throughout multiple CIS courses I’ve been repeatedly reminded of how important it is to fully understand a problem before attempting a solution. Whether that was solving a problem on an assignment or in a technical interview, the most important factors were ensuring you have a complete understanding of the problem, coming up with a clear solution plan or multiple. I went into this work term with the goal of further developing a problem-solving tool kit that allows me to answer: do I understand the problem, and what can I ask to clarify any concerns and ambiguities about the problem, what does a solution to this problem look like, is the problem being described the one that needs to be solved?</p>

            <h5>Communication</h5>
            <p>Whether it was in lectures or going over Coop job postings, a wide variety of varying technologies and languages appear, but written and oral communication has remained a skill that consistently appears as a major focus of both. I went into this work term with the goal of further developing a communication skill set that allows me to communicate effectively with an wide array of people with different personalities, objectives, knowledge and backgrounds. </p>

            <h5>Leadership</h5>
            <p>Working towards a solution as a team has been a major focus of the Software Design courses I’ve completed. As such each Software Design course created opportunities to learn with a single team throughout the semester or multiple about working in a team environment. Because of this I’ve been able to continue to learn and develop my perception of what I need to do to be the ideal colleague within a team. Although there have been many opportunities to work as a team there hasn’t been, or I haven’t taken advantage of, opportunities to lead a team. I went into this work term with the goal of understanding what it’s like to lead a team, as well as to begin developing this new skill set.</p>

        <p class="lead">My overall experience at Dependable IT roughly meet the expectations that I had when I started the work term. For the courses that did have units or impart in addition to the technical material and an additional focus on soft skills this work term has given me an opportunity to experience practical uses of the skills overviewed/taught, as well as develop additional skills. The opportunity to take part of training in a leadership role exceeded any expectation I had about this work term and was the most significant experience I had taken for the term.</p>

            <h5>Communication</h5>
            <p>Over the course of this work term, my daily routine involved me providing support to an average of 60 - 80 telecommunications customers. In providing support to resolve their problems I was able to interact with a wide variety of customers whose personalities and tendencies varied but usually had commonalities. And as my support call times continued to decrease I believed that I gained a better understanding on how to support those different types of customers, whether it was an irate customer that continually interrupts while I’m trying to provide support, begins the support call with rude comment, vents about their situation and the company, a distrusting customer that insists they doesn’t believe there will be a resolution to their situation and repeatedly asks to “Speak with a Supervisor”, as well as “How do you know” and “What happens if” questions, or a customer that's pleased with their service and is just looking for support.</p>

            <h5>Leadership</h5>
            <p>Currently every new hire at Dependable IT goes through two phases of training. One taken place in a classroom environment with a trainer that explains and demonstrates every tool and source of information each technical support agent will need to be successful in their role. The second takes place in the main office, where groups of new hires lead by an experienced technical support agent and take live customer support calls. At the beginning of the work term I had made this goal in the hopes of being able to take part in this training process before the end of the work term, and fortunately I was given a couple opportunities to take part in leading this stage training.  This opportunity allowed me to accomplish my work term goal and begin to develop a tool set around my experience of being responsible for a team. Some skill I believe to have begun to learn are, the importance of facilitating communication within the team and tracking progress throughout training.</p>

            <h5 class="text-center">Leadership <span class="text-muted">- Facilitating Communication</span></h5>
            <p>Each day of training would end with a daily debrief to give new support agents an opportunity to go over situations they struggled through or didn’t understand. While listening and coaching new hires through their calls, I would take notes on specific support calls agents struggled on, as well as some that they handled smoothly, so that these instances could be used as the focal point of our daily debrief for the group to discuss how they handled similar situations in their calls, as well as steps I would have take to resolve the call.</p>
