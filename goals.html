            <h5>Problem Solving</h5>
            <p>Throughout multiple Computer Infomation Science courses I’ve been repeatedly reminded of how important it is to fully understand a problem before attempting a solution. Whether it was solving a problem on an assignment or in a technical interview, the most important factors were ensuring you have a complete understanding of the problem, and coming up with a clear solution plan. I went into this work term with the goal of further developing a problem-solving tool kit that allows me to answer: do I understand the problem; what can I ask to clarify any concerns and ambiguities about the problem; what does a solution to this problem look like; and is the problem being described the one that needs to be solved?</p>

            <h5>Communication</h5>
            <p>Whether in lectures or Coop job postings, a wide variety of varying technologies and languages are required; however but written and oral communication remained as a critical skill. I went into this work term with the goal of further developing a communication skill set that allows me to communicate effectively with a wide array of people with different personalities, objectives, knowledge and backgrounds. </p>

            <h5>Leadership</h5>
            <p>Working towards a solution as a team has been a major focus of the Software Design courses I’ve completed. As such, each Software Design course created the opportunity to learn about working towards a solution as a team and working in team environment. As a result, I’ve been able to continue to learn and develop my perception of what I need to do to be the ideal colleague within a team. Although there have been many opportunities to work within a team, I had not yet have the opportunities to lead a team. I went into this work term with the goal of understanding and developing the skill set required to lead a team effectively.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">What I Took Away From This Work Term</h4>
        <p class="lead">My overall experience at Dependable IT met the expectations that I had when I started the work term. For the courses that did have units or impart in addition to the technical material and an additional focus on soft skills this work term has given me an opportunity to experience practical uses of the skills overviewed/taught, as well as develop additional skills. The opportunity to take part of training in a leadership role exceeded any expectation I had about this work term and was the most significant experience I had taken for the term.</p>

            <h5>Communication</h5>
            <p>Over the course of this work term, my daily routine involved me providing support to an average of 60 - 80 telecommunications customers. In providing support to resolve their problems I was able to interact with a wide variety of customers whose personalities varied but usually had commonalities. As my support call times continued to improve, I gained a better understanding of how to support different types of customers. Whether it was an irate customer that continually interrupts while I’m trying to provide support, made rude comment, vents about their situation and the company; a distrusting customer that doesn’t believe there will be a resolution to their situation and repeatedly asks to “Speak with a Supervisor”, as well as “How do you know” and “What happens if” questions, or a customer that's pleased with their service and is just looking for support.</p>

            <h5>Leadership</h5>
            <p>Currently every new hire at Dependable IT goes through two phases of training. Phase one takes place in a classroom environment with a trainer that explains and demonstrates every tool and source of information each technical support agent will need to be successful in their role. Phase two takes place in the main office, where groups of new hires led by an experienced technical support agent take live customer support calls. At the beginning of the work term my goal was to understand and develop the skill set required to lead a team effectively. I was able to acomplish this when I was given the oportunity of leading the second phase of training. This opportunity allowed me to accomplish my work term goal and begin to develop a skill set around my experience of being responsible for a team. Some of the skills I learned throughout this process are, the importance of facilitating communication within the team and tracking progress throughout training.</p>

            <h5 class="text-center"><span class="text-muted">Facilitating Communication</span></h5>
            <p>Each day of training would end with a daily debrief to give new support agents an opportunity to go over situations they struggled through or didn’t understand. While listening and coaching new hires through their calls, I would take notes on specific support calls agents struggled with, as well as some that they handled smoothly. My notes notes would by used as the focal point of our daily debrief for the group to discuss how each agent handled similar calls, customer service and call handling improvements that each agent could've made,  as well as steps I would have taken to resolve the call.</p>
